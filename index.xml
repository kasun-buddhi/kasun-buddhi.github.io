      <description>Abstract Cleaning is the most common household task we perform in our everyday life. For kids ages 2 to 5, tidying up their room and vacuum cleaning the house is a challenging and tiring task that most people faced in their day-to-day life. This report presents our Final Year Project of Intelligent Floor Cleaning Robot that can perform Object arrangement and Tidy up tasks in the Kids‚Äô Room and efficient cleaning tasks for the Living Room.</description>

      <description>Preview The essential Streamlit for all your data science needs To build a web app you‚Äôd typically use such Python web frameworks as Django and Flask. But the steep learning curve and the big time investment for implementing these apps present a major hurdle.
Streamlit makes the app creation process as simple as writing Python scripts!
In this article, you‚Äôll learn how to master Streamlit when getting started with data science.</description>

      <title>Towards reproducible computational drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://kasunbuddhi.com/projects/reproducible-computational-drug-discovery/</link>

      <description>Abstract The reproducibility of experiments has been a long standing impediment for further scientific progress. Computational methods have been instrumental in drug discovery efforts owing to its multifaceted utilization for data collection, pre-processing, analysis and inference. This article provides an in-depth coverage on the reproducibility of computational drug discovery. This review explores the following topics: (1) the current state-of-the-art on reproducible research, (2) research documentation (e.g. electronic laboratory notebook, Jupyter notebook, etc.</description>

      <title>ERpred: a web server for the prediction of subtype-specific estrogen receptor antagonists</title>

      <description>Abstract Estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERŒ± and ERŒ≤) are responsible for breast cancer metastasis through their involvement of clinical outcomes. Estradiol and hormone replacement therapy targets both ERs, but this often leads to an increased risk of breast and endometrial cancers as well as thromboembolism. A major challenge is posed for the development of compounds possessing ER subtype specificity. Herein, we present a large-scale classification structure-activity relationship (CSAR) study of inhibitors from the ChEMBL database which consisted of an initial set of 11,618 compounds for ERŒ± and 7,810 compounds for ERŒ≤.</description>

      <description>Introduction So you probably have heard of the term Bioinformatics before, but did not get the chance to learn more about what it is and what it can do.
In this article, I will be giving you a brief high-level overview of this exciting field of Bioinformatics. Thus, the article will be comprehensible to those coming from biology or computer backgrounds alike.
As a biologist, I have self-taught myself data science and coding (R and Python) after several years of persistence (initially quitting a couple of times the coding concept just kind of clicked at some point in time).</description>
